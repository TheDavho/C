# My programming projects

Welcome, this repository is my road to become better in programming
I already have some experience in C#, and now want to learn C and python.

**basicRAT** - simple remote access trojan for windows, my beginning in learning sockets and windows API in C

**pythonPractice** - small projects utilizing new things I learned
 
 - **windowResize.py** - my experiment with the GetWindowRect and SetWindowPos functions in Windows API

 - **NetBiosNameChanger.py** - tool to change NetBios name of a windows computer using Windows API
